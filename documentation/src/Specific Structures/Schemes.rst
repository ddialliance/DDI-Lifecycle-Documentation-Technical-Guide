Schemes
========

Schemes are designed to bring together sets of similar objects (i.e. Variables, Concepts, RecordLayouts, etc.) which are managed as a unit for either conceptual or administrative purposes. Schemes have a common structure providing descriptive information about the scheme, a set of similar objects, and the ability to group those objects for administrative purposes.
