GSIM (Generic Statistical Information Model)
=============================================

GSIM provides a standardized set of information objects that flow
through the process model in the creation of official statistics as
represented by the Generic Statistical Business Process Model (GSBPM).
GSBPM has been of interest to DDI since in conception. The DDI Generic
Longitudinal Business Process Model (GLBPM) is modeled on the GSBPM
which itself was informed by the DDI Lifecycle Model. DDI has worked
with the UNECE in the development of GSIM to ensure that these two
standards are compatible. In general, GSIM is a conceptual model whereas
DDI is an implementation model. There is a shared interest in ensuring
that DDI-L can be used as a means of implementing the GSIM conceptual
model.

The primary areas for close mapping to the GSIM structure lies in: 

- areas that relate to their reflection of the ISO/IEC 11179 Data Element Classification Structure. The terminology
for the objects as well as the documentation for the objects reflects the GSIM model.
- mapping to the GSIM Statistical Classification Model (https://statswiki.unece.org/display/gsim/Statistical+Classification+Model). DDi-L 3.2 supports mapping to the GSIM 1.1, The Copenhagen Mapping (https://statswiki.unece.org/display/gsim/CopenhagenMapping) and  DDI-L 3.3 supports the full model.
