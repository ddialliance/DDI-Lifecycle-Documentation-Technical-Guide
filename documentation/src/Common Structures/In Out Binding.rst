In / Out Parameter, Binding and Command Code
---------------------------------------------

The set of classes, InParameter, OutParameter, Binding and CommandCode allow for specific tracking of a set of information (data) through processing. 

For example the response captured by a question is expressed as the OutParameter of the Question. 

A GenerationInstruction specifies that it has an InParameter which goes through a mathematical process resulting in an OutParameter content. A variable has an InParameter. 

Binding is used to link the OutParameter of the Question to the InParamter of the GenerationInstruction. 

The InParameter of the GenerationInstruction to a specific usage in a Command Code and the OutParameter of the GenerationInstruction to the InParameter of a Variable.
